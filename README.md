Overview: The site has been tested on three different browsers
          (Firefox, Edge, and Chrome) and the site performs the same on 
          each of them. There were a few anomolies but they have been
          resolved. 

          The mobile site has it's collage replaced with an image carousel
          there is a small amount of js as a result of that.
